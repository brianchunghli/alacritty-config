  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing
  # I've given in 14 spacing which fits really well with my fonts, you may change it
  # to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that
  #offset:
  #   x: 0
  #   y: 14

# Note: This requires RESTART
# By default when you change the offset above you'll see an issue, where the texts are bottom
# aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
# This offset should usually be 1/2 of the above offset-y being set.
#glyph_offset:
#  x: 0
#    # Keeping this as half of offset to vertically align the text in cursor
#    y: 7
